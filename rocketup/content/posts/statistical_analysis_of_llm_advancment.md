In this article, I'll show the data behind the current development of LLMs and I'll try to make hypotesis on the near future of LLMs.

## I. Pareto Frontier

## II. The Great Doubling

## III. Where Are We?

### Evolution of LLMs' Intelligence

### Evolution of LLMs' Efficency

#### Evolution of LLMs' Efficeny (for higher-ranking models)

### Evolution of LLMs' Speed

#### Evolution of LLMs' Speed (for higher-ranking models)

## IV. Future Predictions

From the given data, I calculated the best approximation of a linear and of a quadratic function to approximate

|                              | +50% [*Linear*] | +50% [*Quadratic*] | +100% [*Linear*] | +100% [*Quadratic*] |
|------------------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Intelligence                 |   2027-12-05   |  2026-08-26    |  **2029-04-16**              | **2027-02-25**                  |
| Intelligence (*openweights*)  |  2029-05-18             |  2026-11-24     | 2031-01-15  | 2027-05-06      |
| Speed                        | 2028-05-11     | 2026-07-16    | 2030-02-25     |    2027-02-12               |
| Speed (*higher-ranking*)       |  2027-09-24   |  2026-04-01          | 2029-02-09   |  2026-09-08          |
| Efficency                    |               |                  |                |                   |
| Efficency (*higher-ranking*)   |               |                  |                |                   |


## V. Conclusion

*P.S.* This post will have new versions when new SOTA models are released, with updated plots and predictions.
