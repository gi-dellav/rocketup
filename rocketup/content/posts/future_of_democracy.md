Let's be honest: democracy is unstable. It is, in my opinion, the single best form of goverment, but it often has mediocre results.

The idea of average results is at the core of democracy: the smaller the number of people in command in a country, the higher the risks and the reward; a monarchy could be lead by a wise philospher or by a brutal dictator, while democracy tries to average out all of the members, in order to avoid the worst, while stopping the best.

If we see all democracies today in the West, there is one element that is in common between all: the average politician does not reflect the needs and the choices of the average citizen; here democracy fails.

So, how can we move the average politician closer to the average citizen? The solution I will talk about today is  **milestone contracts**.

## Application as laws
